Sure! Hereâ€™s an example of how to structure your training module for "Getting Started with Git on a VM":

---

### **1. Getting Started with Git on a VM**

#### **Objective:**
By the end of this module, you will be able to set up a Git environment on a virtual machine, manage a local repository, create a local Git server, and handle branching and merging.

#### **Prerequisites:**
- Basic knowledge of the command line
- An Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) setup (using VirtualBox or another VM software)

#### **Step 1: Setting Up a Local Repository**

- **Install Git on Your Ubuntu VM:**
  - Open the terminal in your Ubuntu VM.
  - Update the package list: 
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
  - Install Git: 
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```
  - Verify the installation: 
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

- **Create a New Local Repository:**
  - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
  - Initialize a new Git repository: 
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
  - Add files to the staging area: 
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - Commit your changes: 
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
  - Commit your changes: 
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

- **Configure Remote Repository (Optional):**
  - If you have a remote Git repository, you can add it using:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>
    ```
  - Push your changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

#### **Step 2: Setting Up a Local Git Server**

- **Create a Local Git Server:**
  - Set up a bare Git repository on your VM, which acts as a server:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/git-server/project.git
    cd ~/git-server/project.git
    git init --bare
    ```
  - On your local machine or another VM, clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone user@vm-ip-address:~/git-server/project.git
    ```
  - Work on the project locally, then push changes back to the server:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push origin main
    ```

- **Simulate a Collaborative Environment:**
  - On another VM, clone the same repository, make changes, and push them back to the server.
  - Practice pulling updates from the server to ensure you have the latest version:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

#### **Step 3: Branching and Merging**

- **Create a New Branch:**
  - To start working on a new feature or experiment:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b new-feature
    ```
  - Make your changes, add them, and commit:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    ```

- **Merging Branches:**
  - Switch back to the main branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```
  - Merge the changes from your new branch:
    ```bash
    git merge new-feature
    ```

- **Resolving Conflicts:**
  - If there are any conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually.
  - Edit the conflicting files, add the resolved files to the staging area:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - Commit the merge:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
    ```

#### **Exercise:**

1. Set up a new local Git repository on your VM.
2. Configure a local Git server and simulate pushing and pulling changes between multiple VMs.
3. Practice creating branches, making changes, and merging them back into the main branch, resolving any conflicts that arise.

This structured approach will help you systematically get started with Git on a VM, covering the basics and allowing for hands-on practice.
